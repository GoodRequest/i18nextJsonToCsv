# JSON to CSV converter script for i18next translations #

This scripts are converting JSON files which is generated by  [ i18next ](https://www.npmjs.com/package/i18next)
to CSV file and also back from CSV to JSON files.

### Implementation ###

First you need to install the module as dev dependency into you project.
```sh
npm install --save-dev GoodRequest/i18nextJsonToCsv
```

Example of script to convert from json to csv
```sh
npx convert-json-to-csv GoodRequest/i18nextJsonToCsv
```
Example of script to convert back from csv to json
```sh
npx convert-csv-to-json GoodRequest/i18nextJsonToCsv
```
This is what a config file looks like
```
{
        // csv delimiter which is used in CSV file, default value is ';'
	"csvDelimiter": ";",
	// path for csv file, default value is "/public/translations.csv"
	"filePathForGeneratedCSV": "/public/translations.csv",
	// the languages which you want to convert, default value is all files which scripts founds
	"supportedLanguages":["cz", "sk", "en"],
	// the json files which you want to convert, default value is all files which scripts founds
	"filesTypes": ["loc", "paths"],
	// path for json files which is generated by i18next scanner, default value is "/public/locales"
	"pathToDirectoryForLocales": "/public/locales"
}
```
Default config
```
{
  "csvDelimiter": ";",
  "filePathForGeneratedCSV": "/public/translations.csv",
  "pathToDirectoryForLocales": "/public/locales"
}
```
You can also use you own config file. But you need pass path to your config file using process environment CONFIG_PATH.
```sh
npx cross-env CONFIG_PATH=/scripts/configs/myConfig.json convert-csv-to-json GoodRequest/i18nextJsonToCsv
```
